# Crowd Supply Staging Area: ShaRPIKeyboard

Hello, intrepid creator. This repository will serve as the home base for your Crowd Supply campaign. You have push access to this repo. Use this repo to communicate all campaign content, content changes, and questions or problems to your Crowd Supply project manager.

## Your Crowd Supply Project Manager

Claire (@SlumberParty) is your pre-launch project manager and primary point of contact with Crowd Supply during the lead-up to your pre-launch page being live. At that point, a project manager will be assigned to help get your project launched. When you've completed or have a question about an issue (see below), you should assign the issue to your project manager.
